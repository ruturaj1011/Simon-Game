## Introduction

The Simon memory game is a classic electronic game of memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights, and the player must repeat the sequence. If the player succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. This project replicates that experience in a web-based format.

## How to Play

1. Press 'Enter' to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors displayed.
3. Click the buttons in the same order to replicate the sequence.
4. With each correct attempt, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.
5. The game continues until you make a mistake. Your score will be the highest level you reached.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Real-time feedback on user input
- High score tracking
- Increasing difficulty with each level
